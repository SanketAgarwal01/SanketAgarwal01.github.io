            <p>Hello there,</p>
            <p> My name is Sanket Agarwal. As of 2020 I have completed my undergraduation in Computer Science and Engineering.</p>
            <p> I have also been a Financial Consultant for the past 2.5 years. My work included making projections, doing financial reporting and analysis for small scale startups and MNC's e.g Spice Jet.</p>
            <p>  So enough of my work and professional experiences, now let's move onto some interesting stuff about me. </p>
            <p>So, other than all my consultancy projects, I have also been a photographer(Hobbist). As a photographer I have been involved as an instructor with Nikon India for 3 months conducting 3 workshops. I was also fortunate enough to be able to do a short video shoot for an international client in Thailand for a wedding. I have also been into music and have been playing guitar since last 8 years.</p>
            <p>These are the few things that I have done in the past.</p>
